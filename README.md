# CodingExcercise
Eargo homework exercise instruction

For the excercise 1 and excercise 3, I solve the problems in Python. You can download them and open them by PyCharm. I provide one text case below the algorithm. You will see the result after running the code. To execute my code with different test cases, just change the inputs.

For the excercise 2, you can run the SQL text file on MySQL Workbench. Before that you have to build a shema and a table under the schema. In my case, the schema name is pages and the table name is input.
